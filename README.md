> Country flag icons for the Ichava Laravel icon ecosystem: 542 SVGs, 271 flags in `4x3` and `1x1` ratios, vendored from `lipis/flag-icons`.

Requires [`ichava/core`](https://github.com/ichava/core) `^0.1` on PHP `^8.4.1 || ^8.5` and Laravel `^13`.

## Install

This pack requires [`ichava/core`](https://github.com/ichava/core) and nothing else. Nothing in the Ichava family is on Packagist yet, so the **application's** `composer.json` first names the repositories: core's [installation guide](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/installation.md#1-point-composer-at-the-repositories) holds the one block that lists them, core's dependencies included, and this pack's line in it is `https://github.com/ichava/icon-sets-flag`.

Then require the pack:

```bash
composer require ichava/icon-sets-flag
```

The service provider is discovered automatically. Core's [installation guide](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/installation.md) covers core's own setup.

## Quick start guide and usage

### Getting started

Seed the pack once after installing it, and again after upgrading it:

```bash
php artisan ichava::ichava-core.database seed --package=ichava/icon-sets-flag
```

The seed is not optional: until it runs the registry holds no rows for this pack and every lookup returns nothing. No configuration is needed; the defaults are merged without publishing anything.

### Usage

Icons are addressed as `ichava/icon-sets-flag::<ratio>/<code>`. In Blade, through core's component:

```blade
<x-ichava::icon name="ichava/icon-sets-flag::4x3/us" class="w-6 h-4" />
```

Or from PHP, through core's helper:

```blade
{{ ichava('ichava/icon-sets-flag::1x1/de')->class('w-5 h-5') }}
```

See [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for the full walkthrough, and the [Documentation](#documentation) index below for everything else.
